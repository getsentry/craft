## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Every Craft deployment nukes the CNAME file on the gh-pages branch because
the gh-pages target does a destructive `git rm -rf .` before extracting the
new archive contents. This causes craft.sentry.dev to stop resolving after
each release.

### Analysis
1. The gh-pages target's full-replacement behavior is by design — no code change needed there.
2. The getsentry/cli repo solves this by placing a CNAME file in `docs/public/`. Astro copies
   public/ contents into dist/ at build time, so the CNAME ends up in the deployment archive.
3. The Craft repo was missing this file.

### Solution
Add `docs/public/CNAME` containing `craft.sentry.dev`. No changes to the gh-pages target
code or .craft.yml configuration are needed.

### Alternatives Considered
- Adding CNAME awareness to the gh-pages target (rejected: unnecessary complexity)
- Adding a `cname` config option to the gh-pages target (rejected: same reason)

Both alternatives were rejected because the build-time inclusion pattern used by
getsentry/cli is simpler and already proven.
