## 0.21.1

- fix: Upgrade simple-git to latest version (#207)

## 0.21.0

- fix: No prod dependencies (#204)
- build: Move to single-file builds for craft (#203)
- fix(github): Revert retry on 404s (#199)
- fix(gcs): Fix GCS artifact provider on Windows (#200)
- feat(config): Use GitHub as default provider (#202)

  **Breaking Change:** This version changes the default configuration values for
  `statusProvider` and `artifactProvider` to `github` if `minVersion` is greater
  or equal to `0.21.0`. If your craft configuration file does not set these
  providers explicitly, you can keep the old behavior by modifying your config:

  ```yaml
  minVersion: 0.21.0
  artifactProvider:
    name: zeus
  statusProvider:
    name: zeus
  ```

  Support for Zeus will be dropped in a future release and we highly recommend
  updating your CI workflows to use GitHub.
