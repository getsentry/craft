## Implementation Plan

### Problem
The changelog preview job always shows "Semver Impact" with semver badges
(Major/Minor/Patch), even for CalVer projects where versions are date-based.
This confuses users who see semver concepts that do not apply to their project.

### Design Decisions
- Detection happens in the craft CLI: `craft changelog --format json` now
  includes a `versioningPolicy` field ("auto", "manual", or "calver") read
  from .craft.yml via `findConfigFile()` + `getVersioningPolicy()`.
- Graceful fallback: if no config file or config parse error, defaults to
  "auto" (preserving existing semver behavior).
- The workflow reads the policy and branches on it:
  - CalVer: empty bump badge, heading "Changelog Preview", status context
    "Changelog Preview", description "CalVer".
  - Auto/Manual: unchanged semver badges, heading "Semver Impact of This PR",
    status context "Changelog Preview / Semver Impact".
- For CalVer, the bump badge is omitted entirely (no note about CalVer in the
  body) to avoid repetitive noise on every PR.
- Manual policy keeps showing semver impact since manual versions still follow
  semver conventions.

### Changes
1. src/commands/changelog.ts - Added versioningPolicy to JSON output
2. .github/workflows/changelog-preview.yml - Conditional display for CalVer
3. src/commands/__tests__/changelog-versioning-policy.test.ts - 6 tests

### Test Coverage
- calver/auto/manual policies in JSON output
- Fallback when no config file exists
- Fallback when getVersioningPolicy() throws
- Text output does not include versioningPolicy
