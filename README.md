## Global Configuration

`craft` requires a few environment variables to be present in order to function
properly.

* `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`

  Get your personal GitHub API token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens

  The token only needs "repo" scope.

* `ZEUS_TOKEN`

  You can generate your personal Zeus token here: https://zeus.ci/settings/token

  Required only for `craft publish`.

Additional environment variables can be required when publishing to specific
targets (e.g. `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` for PyPI target).

### `craft release`: Preparing a New Release

This command will create a new release branch, check the changelog entries
(TODO), run a version-bumping script, and push the new branch to GitHub.

```
craft release [part]

ðŸš¢ Prepare a new release branch

Positionals:
  part, p  The part of the version to increase
                [string] [choices: "major", "minor", "patch"] [default: "patch"]

Options:
  --new-version          The new version to release          [string] [required]
  --push-release-branch  Push the release branch       [boolean] [default: true]
```

### `craft publish`: Publishing the Release

The command will find a release branch for the provided version (tag) and
publish the existing artifacts from Zeus to configured targets.

```
craft publish

ðŸ›« Publish artifacts

Options:
  --target, -t            Publish to this target
                              [string] [choices: "github", "npm", "pypi", "all"]

  --new-version, -n       Version to publish                 [string] [required]
  --merge-release-branch  Merge the release branch after publishing
                                                       [boolean] [default: true]
  --remove-downloads      Remove all downloaded files after each invocation
                                                       [boolean] [default: true]

                                                       [boolean] [default: true]
```

### Example

Let's imagine we want to release a new version of our package, and the version
in question is `1.2.3`.

We run `release` command first:

`$ craft release --new-version 1.2.3`

After some basic sanity checks this command creates a new release branch
`release/1.2.3`, runs the version-bumping script (`scripts/bump-version.sh`),
commits the changes made by the script, and then pushes the new branch to
GitHub. At this point CI systems kick in, and the results of those builds, as
well as built artifacts (binaries, NPM archives, Python wheels) are gradually
uploaded to Zeus.

To publish the built artifacts we run `publish`:

`$ craft publish --new-version 1.2.3`

This command will find our release branch (`release/1.2.3`), check the build
status of the respective git revision in Zeus, and then publish available
artifacts to configured targets (for example, to GitHub and NPM in the case of
Craft).

## Configuration File: `.craft.yml`

Project configuration for `craft` is stored in `.craft.yml` configuration file,
located in the project root.

One of the required settings you need to specify is GitHub project parameters:

```yaml
github:
  owner: getsentry
  repo: craft
```

Additionally, `.craft.yml` is used for listing targets where you want to
publish your new release.

## Target Configuration

The configuration specifies which release targets to run for the repository. To
run more targets, list the target identifiers under the `targets` key in
`.craft.yml`.

**Example:**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: github
  - name: npm
```

### GitHub (`github`)

Create a release on Github. If a Markdown changelog is present in the
repository, this target tries to read the release name and description from the
changelog. Otherwise, defaults to the tag name and tag's commit message.

**Environment**

| Name               | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (seeh ttps://github.com/settings/tokens) |

**Configuration**

| Option      | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `changelog` | **optional**. Path to the changelog file. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md` |

**Example:**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: github
    changelog: CHANGES
```

### NPM (`npm`)

Releases a NPM package to the public registry. This requires a package tarball
generated by `npm pack` in the artifacts. The file will be uploaded to the
registry with `npm publish`. This requires NPM to be authenticated with
sufficient permissions to publish the package.

**Environment**

The `npm` utility must be installed on the system.

| Name      | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NPM_BIN` | **optional**. Path to the npm executable. Defaults to `npm` |

**Configuration**

| Option   | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `access` | **optional**. Visibility for scoped packages: `public` (default) or `restricted` |

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: npm
    access: restricted
```

### Python Package Index (`pypi`)

Uploads source dists and wheels to the Python Package Index via [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).
The source code bundles and/or wheels must be in the release assets.

**Environment**

The `twine` package must be installed on the system.

| Name             | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `TWINE_USERNAME` | User name for PyPI with access rights for the package |
| `TWINE_PASSWORD` | Password for the PyPI user                            |
| `TWINE_BIN`      | **optional**. Path to twine. Defaults to `twine`      |

**Configuration**

_none_

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: pypi
```

### Homebrew (`brew`)

Pushes a new or updated homebrew formula to a brew tap repository. The formula
is committed directly to the master branch of the tap on GitHub, therefore the
bot needs rights to commit to `master` on that repository. Therefore, formulas
on `homebrew/core` are not supported, yet.

The tap is configured with the mandatory `tap` parameter in the same format as
the `brew` utility. A tap `<org>/<name>` will expand to the GitHub repository
`github.com:<org>/homebrew-<name>`.

The formula contents are given as configuration value and can be interpolated
with `${ variable }`. The interpolation context contains the following
variables:

* `ref`: The tag's reference name. Usually the version number
* `sha`: The tag's commit SHA
* `checksums`: A map containing sha256 checksums for every release asset. Use
  the full filename to access the sha, e.g. `checksums['MyProgram.exe']`

**Environment**

| Name               | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (seeh ttps://github.com/settings/tokens) |

**Configuration**

| Option     | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tap`      | The name of the homebrew tap used to access the GitHub repo        |
| `template` | The template for contents of the formula file (ruby code)          |
| `formula`  | **optional**. Name of the formula. Defaults to the repository name |
| `path`     | **optional**. Path to store the formula in. Defaults to `Formula`  |

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: brew
    tap: octocat/tools     # Expands to github.com:octocat/homebrew-tools
    formula: myproject     # Creates the file myproject.rb
    path: HomebrewFormula  # Creates the file in HomebrewFormula/
    template: >
      class MyProject < Formula
        desc "This is a test for homebrew formulae"
        homepage "https://github.com/octocat/my-project"
        url "https://github.com/octocat/my-project/releases/download/${ref}/binary-darwin"
        version "${ref}"
        sha256 "${checksums['binary-darwin']}"

        def install
          mv "binary-darwin", "myproject"
          bin.install "myproject"
        end
      end
```

## Version-bumping Script: Conventions

Among other actions, `craft release` runs an external project-specific script
that is responsible for version bumping. By default, this script should be
located at the following path: `scripts/bump-version.sh` (relative to the
project root).

The following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:

* The script must accept two arguments: the first one is the old ("from")
  version, and the second one is the new ("to") version.
* The script must replace all relevant occurrences of the old version string
  with the new one.
* The script must not commit the changes made.
* The script must not change the state of the git repository (e.g. changing branches)

**Example**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
### Example of a version-bumping script for an NPM project.
### Located at: scripts/bump-version.sh
set -eux
OLD_VERSION="${1}"
NEW_VERSION="${2}"

# Do not tag and commit changes made by "npm version"
export npm_config_git_tag_version=false
npm version "${NEW_VERSION}"
```

## Development

### Logging level

Logging level for `craft` can be configured via setting `CRAFT_LOG_LEVEL`
environment variable.

Accepted values are: `debug`, `success` (default), `info`, `warn`, `error`.

### Dry-run mode

Dry-run mode can be enabled via setting `DRY_RUN` environment variable to any
truthy value (any value other than `unset`, `""`, `0`, `false` and `no`).

In dry-run mode no destructive actions will be performed (creating branches,
pushing tags, committing files, etc.)

### Releasing

`craft` obviously uses `craft` for preparing and publishing new releases!
