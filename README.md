## Installation

### Binary

`craft` is [distributed as a minified single JS binary](https://github.com/getsentry/craft/releases/latest).

### npm (not recommended)

Recommendation is to used this file directly but one can also install `craft` as
an [NPM package](https://yarn.pm/@sentry/craft) and can be installed via `yarn`
or `npm`:

```shell
yarn global add @sentry/craft
```

```shell
npm install -g @sentry/craft
```

## Usage

```shell
$ craft -h
craft <command>

Commands:
  craft prepare NEW-VERSION  ðŸš¢ Prepare a new release branch
                          [aliases: p, prerelease, prepublish, prepare, release]
  craft publish NEW-VERSION  ðŸ›« Publish artifacts         [aliases: pp, publish]
  craft targets              List defined targets as JSON array
  craft config               Print the parsed, processed, and validated Craft
                             config for the current project in pretty-JSON.
  craft artifacts <command>  ðŸ“¦ Manage artifacts          [aliases: a, artifact]

Options:
  --no-input     Suppresses all user prompts                    [default: false]
  --dry-run      Dry run mode: do not perform any real actions
  --log-level    Logging level
          [choices: "Fatal", "Error", "Warn", "Log", "Info", "Success", "Debug",
                                 "Trace", "Silent", "Verbose"] [default: "Info"]
  -v, --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -h, --help     Show help                                             [boolean]
```

## Caveats

- When interacting with remote GitHub repositories, `craft` uses the
  remote `origin` by default. If you have a different setup, set the
  `CRAFT_REMOTE` environment variable or the `--remote` option to the git remote
  you are using.

## Global Configuration

Global configuration for `craft` can be done either by using environment
variables or by adding values to a configuration file (see below).

All command line flags can be set through environment variables by prefixing
them with `CRAFT_` and converting them to UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORED versions:

```shell
CRAFT_LOG_LEVEL=Debug
CRAFT_DRY_RUN=1
CRAFT_NO_INPUT=0
```

Since Craft heavily relies on GitHub, it needs the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable to be set to a proper
[GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for almost
anything. The token only needs `repo` scope (`repo:status` and `public_repo`
subscopes, to be precise).

Additional environment variables may be required when publishing to specific
targets (e.g. `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` for PyPI target).

### Environment Files

`craft` will read configuration variables (keys, tokens, etc.) from the
following locations:

- `$HOME/.craft.env`
- `$PROJECT_DIR/.craft.env`
- the shell's environment

where `$HOME` is the current user's home directory, and `$PROJECT_DIR` is the
directory where `.craft.yml` is located.

These locations will be checked in the order specified above, with values
found in one location overwriting anything found in previous locations. In other
words, environment variables will take precedence over either configuration
file, and the project-specific file will take precedence over the file in
`$HOME`.

The env files must be written in shell (`sh`/`bash`) format.
Leading `export` is allowed.

Example:

```shell
# ~/.craft.env
GITHUB_TOKEN=token123
export NUGET_API_TOKEN=abcdefgh
```

## Workflow

### `craft prepare`: Preparing a New Release

This command will create a new release branch, check the changelog entries,
run a version-bumping script, and push this branch to GitHub. We expect
that CI triggered by pushing this branch will result in release artifacts
being built and uploaded to the artifact provider you wish to use during the
subsequent `publish` step.

```shell
craft prepare NEW-VERSION

ðŸš¢ Prepare a new release branch

Positionals:
  NEW-VERSION  The new version you want to release           [string] [required]

Options:
  --no-input       Suppresses all user prompts                  [default: false]
  --dry-run        Dry run mode: do not perform any real actions
  --log-level      Logging level
          [choices: "Fatal", "Error", "Warn", "Log", "Info", "Success", "Debug",
                                 "Trace", "Silent", "Verbose"] [default: "Info"]
  --rev, -r        Source revision (git SHA or tag) to prepare from (if not
                   branch head)                                         [string]
  --no-push        Do not push the release branch     [boolean] [default: false]
  --no-git-checks  Ignore local git changes and unsynchronized remotes
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --no-changelog   Do not check for changelog entries [boolean] [default: false]
  --publish        Run "publish" right after "release"[boolean] [default: false]
  --remote         The git remote to use when pushing
                                                    [string] [default: "origin"]
  -v, --version    Show version number                                 [boolean]
  -h, --help       Show help                                           [boolean]
```

### `craft publish`: Publishing the Release

The command will find a release branch for the provided version. The normal flow
is for this release branch to be created automatically by `craft prepare`, but
that's not strictly necessary. Then, it subscribes to the latest status checks on
that branch. Once the checks pass, it downloads the release artifacts from the
artifact provider configured in `.craft.yml` and uploads them to the targets named
on the command line (and pre-configured in `.craft.yml`).

```shell
craft publish NEW-VERSION

ðŸ›« Publish artifacts

Positionals:
  NEW-VERSION  Version to publish                            [string] [required]

Options:
  --no-input         Suppresses all user prompts                [default: false]
  --dry-run          Dry run mode: do not perform any real actions
  --log-level        Logging level
          [choices: "Fatal", "Error", "Warn", "Log", "Info", "Success", "Debug",
                                 "Trace", "Silent", "Verbose"] [default: "Info"]
  --target, -t       Publish to this target
    [string] [choices: "npm", "gcs", "registry", "docker", "github", "gh-pages",
                                                 "all", "none"] [default: "all"]
  --rev, -r          Source revision (git SHA or tag) to publish (if not release
                     branch head)                                       [string]
  --no-merge         Do not merge the release branch after publishing
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --keep-branch      Do not remove release branch after merging it
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --keep-downloads   Keep all downloaded files        [boolean] [default: false]
  --no-status-check  Do not check for build status    [boolean] [default: false]
  -v, --version      Show version number                               [boolean]
  -h, --help         Show help                                         [boolean]
```

### Example

Let's imagine we want to release a new version of our package, and the version
in question is `1.2.3`.

We run `prepare` command first:

`$ craft prepare 1.2.3`

After some basic sanity checks this command creates a new release branch
`release/1.2.3`, runs the version-bumping script (`scripts/bump-version.sh`),
commits the changes made by the script, and then pushes the new branch to
GitHub. At this point CI systems kick in, and the results of those builds, as
well as built artifacts (binaries, NPM archives, Python wheels) are gradually
uploaded to GitHub.

To publish the built artifacts we run `publish`:

`$ craft publish 1.2.3`

This command will find our release branch (`release/1.2.3`), check the build
status of the respective git revision in GitHub, and then publish available
artifacts to configured targets (for example, to GitHub and NPM in the case of
Craft).

## Configuration File: `.craft.yml`

Project configuration for `craft` is stored in `.craft.yml` configuration file,
located in the project root.

### GitHub project

Craft tries to determine the GitHub repo information from the local git repo and
its remotes configuration. However, since `publish` command does not require a
local git checkout, you may want to hard-code this information into the
configuration itself:

```yaml
github:
  owner: getsentry
  repo: sentry-javascript
```

### Pre-release Command

This command will run on your newly created release branch as part of `prepare`
command. By default, it is set to `bash scripts/bump-version.sh`. Please refer
to the [Pre-release version bumping script conventions section](#pre-release-version-bumping-script-conventions)
for more details.

```yaml
preReleaseCommand: bash scripts/bump-version.sh
```

### Post-release Command

This command will run after a successful `publish`. By default, it is set to
`bash scripts/post-release.sh`. It will _not_ error if the default script is
missing though, as this may not be needed by all projects. Please refer to the
[Post-release script conventions section](#post-release-script-conventions)
for more details.

```yaml
postReleaseCommand: bash scripts/post-release.sh
```

### Release Branch Name

This overrides the prefix for the release branch name. The full branch name used
for a release is `{releaseBranchPrefix}/{version}`. The prefix defaults to
`"release"`.

```yaml
releaseBranchPrefix: publish
```

### Changelog Policies

`craft` can help you to maintain change logs for your projects. At the moment,
`craft` supports two approaches: `simple`, and `auto` to changelog management.

In `simple` mode, `craft prepare` will remind you to add a changelog entry to the
changelog file (`CHANGELOG.md` by default).

In `auto` mode, `craft prepare` will use the following logic:

1. If there's already an entry for the given version, use that
2. Else if there is an entry named `Unreleased`, rename that to the given
   version
3. Else, create a new section for the version and populate it with the changes
   since the last version. It uses [GitHub Milestones](https://git.io/Jzlqy) to
   provide a concise and rich changelog. If the PRs are associated with a
   milestone, the milestone title and description are used as the changelog
   entry alongside a brief list of associated PRs. Any individual commits and
   PRs are listed under the "Various improvements & fixes" section at the
   bottom. Check out [Craft's own releases](https://git.io/Jzlmu) as example.

**Configuration**

| Option            | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `changelog`       | **optional**. Path to the changelog file. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md`                       |
| `changelogPolicy` | **optional**. Changelog management mode (`none`, `simple`, or `auto`). Defaults to `none`. |

**Example (`simple`):**

```yaml
changelog: CHANGES
changelogPolicy: simple
```

**Valid changelog example:**

```text
## 1.3.5

* Removed something

## 1.3.4

* Added something
```

**Example (`auto`):**

```yaml
changelog: CHANGES
changelogPolicy: auto
```

**Changelog with staged changes example:**

```text
## Unreleased

* Removed something

## 1.3.4

* Added something
```

Additionally, `.craft.yml` is used for listing targets where you want to
publish your new release.

### Minimal Version

It is possible to specify minimal `craft` version that is required to work with
your configuration.

**Example:**

```yaml
minVersion: '0.5.0'
```

### Required Files

You can provide a list of patterns for files that _have to be_ available before
proceeding with publishing. In other words, for every pattern in the given list
there has to be a file present that matches that pattern. This might be helpful
to ensure that we're not trying to do an incomplete release.

**Example:**

```yaml
requireNames:
  - /^sentry-craft.*\.tgz$/
  - /^gh-pages.zip$/
```

## Status Provider

You can configure which status providers `craft` will use to check for your build status.
By default, it will use GitHub but you can add more providers if needed.

**Configuration**

| Option   | Description                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | Name of the status provider: only `github` (default) for now.                                      |
| `config` | In case of `github`: may include `contexts` key that contains a list of required contexts (checks) |

**Example:**

```yaml
statusProvider:
  name: github
  config:
    contexts:
      - Travis CI - Branch
```

## Artifact Provider

You can configure which artifact providers `craft` will use to fetch artifacts from.
By default, GitHub is used, but in case you don't need use any artifacts in your
project, you can set it to `none`.

**Configuration**

| Option | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name` | Name of the artifact provider: `github` (default), `gcs`, or `none` |

**Example:**

```yaml
artifactProvider:
  name: none
```

## Target Configurations

The configuration specifies which release targets to run for the repository. To
run more targets, list the target identifiers under the `targets` key in
`.craft.yml`.

**Example:**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: npm
  - name: github
  - name: registry
    id: browser
    type: sdk
    onlyIfPresent: /^sentry-browser-.*\.tgz$/
    includeNames: /\.js$/
    checksums:
      - algorithm: sha384
        format: base64
    config:
      canonical: 'npm:@sentry/browser'
  - name: registry
    id: node
    type: sdk
    onlyIfPresent: /^sentry-node-.*\.tgz$/
    config:
      canonical: 'npm:@sentry/node'
```

### Per-target options

The following options can be applied to every target individually:

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `includeNames` | **optional**. Regular expression: only matched files will be processed by the target. There is one special case that `includeNames` supports.                                                          |
| `excludeNames` | **optional**. Regular expression: the matched files will be skipped by the target. Matching is performed after testing for inclusion (via `includeNames`).                                             |
| `id`           | **optional**. A unique id for the target type so one can refer to that target individually with the `-t` option with the `publish` command like `-t registry[browser]`. (see the example config above) |

If neither option is included, all artifacts for the release will be processed by the target.

**Example:**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: github
    includeNames: /^.*\.exe$/
    excludeNames: /^test.exe$/
```

### GitHub (`github`)

Create a release on Github. If a Markdown changelog is present in the
repository, this target tries to read the release name and description from the
changelog. Otherwise, defaults to the tag name and tag's commit message.

If `previewReleases` is set to `true` (which is the default), the release
created on GitHub will be marked as a pre-release version if the release name
contains any one of `preview`, `pre`, `rc`, `dev`,`alpha`, `beta`, `unstable`,
`a`, or `b`.

**Environment**

| Name           | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (see https://github.com/settings/tokens) |

**Configuration**

| Option            | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tagPrefix`       | **optional**. Prefix for new git tags (e.g. "v"). Empty by default.                          |
| `previewReleases` | **optional**. Automatically detect and create preview releases. `true` by default.           |
| `annotatedTag`    | **optional**. Creates an annotated tag, set to false for lightweight tag. `true` by default. |

**Example:**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: github
    tagPrefix: v
    previewReleases: false
    annotatedTag: false
```

### NPM (`npm`)

Releases an NPM package to the public registry. This requires a package tarball
generated by `npm pack` in the artifacts. The file will be uploaded to the
registry with `npm publish`, or with `yarn publish` if `npm` is not found. This
requires NPM to be authenticated with sufficient permissions to publish the package.

**Environment**

The `npm` utility must be installed on the system.

| Name                | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NPM_TOKEN`         | An [automation token][npm-automation-token] allowed to publish.     |
| `NPM_BIN`           | **optional**. Path to the npm executable. Defaults to `npm`         |
| `YARN_BIN`          | **optional**. Path to the yarn executable. Defaults to `yarn`       |
| `CRAFT_NPM_USE_OTP` | **optional**. If set to "1", you will be asked for an OTP (for 2FA) |

[npm-automation-token]: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens

**Configuration**

| Option   | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `access` | **optional**. Visibility for scoped packages: `restricted` (default) or `public` |

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: npm
    access: public
```

### Python Package Index (`pypi`)

Uploads source dists and wheels to the Python Package Index via [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).
The source code bundles and/or wheels must be in the release assets.

**Environment**

The `twine` Python package must be installed on the system.

| Name             | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `TWINE_USERNAME` | User name for PyPI with access rights for the package |
| `TWINE_PASSWORD` | Password for the PyPI user                            |
| `TWINE_BIN`      | **optional**. Path to twine. Defaults to `twine`      |

**Configuration**

_none_

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: pypi
```

### Homebrew (`brew`)

Pushes a new or updated homebrew formula to a brew tap repository. The formula
is committed directly to the master branch of the tap on GitHub, therefore the
bot needs rights to commit to `master` on that repository. Therefore, formulas
on `homebrew/core` are not supported, yet.

The tap is configured with the mandatory `tap` parameter in the same format as
the `brew` utility. A tap `<org>/<name>` will expand to the GitHub repository
`github.com:<org>/homebrew-<name>`.

The formula contents are given as configuration value and can be interpolated
with Mustache template syntax (`{{ variable }}`). The interpolation context
contains the following variables:

- `version`: The new version
- `revision`: The tag's commit SHA
- `checksums`: A map containing sha256 checksums for every release asset. Use

### Google Cloud Storage (`gcs`)

Uploads artifacts to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage.

The bucket paths (`paths`) can be interpolated using Mustache syntax (`{{ variable }}`). The interpolation context contains the following variables:

- `version`: The new project version
- `revision`: The SHA revision of the new version

**Environment**

Google Cloud credentials can be provided using either of the following two environment variables.

| Name                          | Description                                                              |

_Note:_ `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` and `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH` were formerly called `CRAFT_GCS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` and `CRAFT_GCS_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, respectively. While those names will continue to work for the foreseeable future, you'll receive a warning encouraging you to switch to the new names.

**Configuration**

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |

      - path: release/{{version}}/download
        metadata:
          cacheControl: `public, max-age=3600`
      - path: release/{{revision}}/platform/package
```

### GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`)

Extracts an archive with static assets and pushes them to the specified git
branch (`gh-pages` by default). Thus, it can be used to publish documentation
or any other assets to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so they will be later automatically rendered
by GitHub.

By default, this target will look for an artifact named `gh-pages.zip`, extract it,
and commit its contents to `gh-pages` branch.

_WARNING!_ The destination branch will be completely overwritten by the contents
of the archive.

**Environment**

_none_

**Configuration**

| Option        | Description                                                                             |

| `githubOwner` | **optional** GitHub project owner, defaults to the value from the global configuration. |
| `githubRepo`  | **optional** GitHub project name, defaults to the value from the global configuration.  |

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: gh-pages
    branch: gh-pages
```

### Sentry Release Registry (`registry`)

The target will update the Sentry release registry repo(https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-release-registry/) with the latest version of the
project `craft` is used with. The release registry repository will be checked out
locally, and then the new version file will be created there, along with the necessary
symbolic links.

Two package types are supported: "sdk" and "app". Type "sdk" means that the package
is uploaded to one of the public registries (PyPI, NPM, Nuget, etc.), and that
the corresponding package directory can be found inside "packages" directory of the
release regsitry. Type "app" indicates that the package's version files are located
in "apps" directory of the registry.

It is strongly discouraged to have multiple `registry` targets in a config as it
supports grouping/batching multiple apps and SDKs in a single target.

**Environment**

_none_

**Configuration**

| Option                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `(sdks\|apps).onlyIfPresent`   | **optional** A file pattern. The target will be executed _only_ when the matched file is found.                                                                                                                                            |

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: registry
    sdks:
      'npm:@sentry/browser':
    apps:
      'npm:@sentry/browser':
        urlTemplate: 'https://example.com/{{version}}/{{file}}'
        checksums:
          - algorithm: sha256
            format: hex
```

### Cocoapods (`cocoapods`)

Pushes a new podspec to the central cocoapods repository. The Podspec is fetched
from the Github repository with the revision that is being released. No release
assets are required for this target.

### Docker (`docker`)

Pulls an existing source image tagged with the revision SHA, and then pushed it
to a new target tagged with the released version. No release
assets are required for this target except for the source image at the provided
source image location so it would be a good idea to add a status check that
ensures the source image exists, otherwise `craft publish` will fail at the
`docker pull` step, causing an interrupted publish. This is an issue for other,
non-idempotent targets, not for the Docker target.

**Environment**

`docker` executable (or something equivalent) must be installed on the system.

| Option           | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serverEndpoint` | **optional** The server endpoint. Defaults to `https://symbol-collector.services.sentry.io`. |
| `batchType`      | The batch type of the symbols to be uploaded. I.e: `Android`, `macOS`, `iOS`.                |
| `bundleIdPrefix` | The prefix of the bundle ID. The new version will be appended to the end of this prefix.     |

**Example**

```yaml
targets:
  - name: symbol-collector
    includeNames: /libsentry(-android)?\.so/
    batchType: Android
    bundleIdPrefix: android-ndk-
```

## Integrating Your Project with `craft`

Here is how you can integrate your GitHub project with `craft`:

1. Set up a workflow that builds your assets and runs your tests. Allow building
   release branches (their names follow `release/{VERSION}` by default,
   configurable through `releaseBranchPrefix`).

   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - 'release/**'
   ```

2. Use the official `actions/upload-artifact@v2` action to upload your assets.
   Here is an example config (step) of an archive job:

   ```yaml
   - name: Archive Artifacts
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
     with:
       name: ${{ github.sha }}
       path: |
         ${{ github.workspace }}/*.tgz
         ${{ github.workspace }}/packages/tracing/build/**
         ${{ github.workspace }}/packages/**/*.tgz
   ```

   A few important things to note:

   - The name of the artifacts is very important and needs to be `name: ${{ github.sha }}`. Craft uses this as a unique id to fetch the artifacts.
   - Keep in mind that this action maintains the folder structure and zips everything together. Craft will download the zip and recursively walk it to find all assets.

3. Add `.craft.yml` configuration file to your project

   - List there all the targets you want to publish to
   - Configure additional options (changelog management policy, tag prefix, etc.)

4. Add a [pre-release script](#pre-release-version-bumping-script-conventions) to your project.
5. Get various [configuration tokens](#global-configuration)
6. Run `craft prepare <version> --publish` and profit!

## Pre-release (Version-bumping) Script: Conventions

Among other actions, `craft prepare` runs an external, project-specific command
or script that is responsible for version bumping. By default, this script
should be located at: `./scripts/bump-version.sh`. The command can be configured
by specifying the `preReleaseCommand` configuration option in `craft.yml`.

The following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:

- The script should accept at least two arguments. Craft will pass the old ("from")
  version and the new ("to") version as the last two arguments, respectively.
- The script must replace all relevant occurrences of the old version string
  with the new one.
- The script must not commit the changes made.
- The script must not change the state of the git repository (e.g. changing branches)

**Example**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
### Example of a version-bumping script for an NPM project.
### Located at: ./scripts/bump-version.sh
set -eux
OLD_VERSION="${1}"
NEW_VERSION="${2}"

# Do not tag and commit changes made by "npm version"
export npm_config_git_tag_version=false
npm version "${NEW_VERSION}"
```

## Post-release Script: Conventions

Among other actions, `craft publish` runs an external, project-specific command
or script that can do things like bumping the development version. By default,
this script should be located at: `./scripts/post-release.sh`. Unlike the
pre-release command, this script is not mandatory so if the file does not exist,
`craft` will report this fact and then move along as usual. This command can be
configured by specifying `postReleaseCommand` configuration option in `craft.yml`.

The following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:

- The script should accept at least two arguments. Craft will pass the old ("from")
  version and the new ("to") version as the last two arguments, respectively.
- The script is responsible for any and all `git` state management as `craft` will
  simply exit after running this script as the final step. This means the script
  is responsible for committing and pushing any changes that it may have made.

**Example**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
### Example of a dev-version-bumping script for a Python project
### Located at: ./scripts/post-release.sh
set -eux
OLD_VERSION="${1}"
NEW_VERSION="${2}"

# Ensure master branch
git checkout master
# Advance the CalVer release by one-month and add the `.dev0` suffix
./scripts/bump-version.sh '' $(date -d "$(echo $NEW_VERSION | sed -e 's/^\([0-9]\{2\}\)\.\([0-9]\{1,2\}\)\.[0-9]\+$/20\1-\2-1/') 1 month" +%y.%-m.0.dev0)
# Only commit if there are changes, make sure to `pull --rebase` before pushing to avoid conflicts
git diff --quiet || git commit -anm 'meta: Bump new development version' && git pull --rebase && git push
```

## Development

### Logging Level

Logging level for `craft` can be configured via setting the `CRAFT_LOG_LEVEL`
environment variable or using the `--log-level` CLI flag.

Accepted values are: `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Log`, `Info`, `Success`,
`Debug`, `Trace`, `Silent`, `Verbose`

### Dry-run Mode

Dry-run mode can be enabled via setting the `CRAFT_DRY_RUN` environment variable
to any truthy value (any value other than `undefined`, `null`, `""`, `0`,
`false`, and `no`). One may also use the `--dry-run` CLI flag.

In dry-run mode no destructive actions will be performed (creating remote
branches, pushing tags, committing files, etc.)

### Sentry Support

Errors you encounter while using Craft can be sent to Sentry. To use this
feature, add `CRAFT_SENTRY_DSN` variable to your environment (or "craft"
configuration file) that contains a Sentry project's DSN.

For example:

```shell
export CRAFT_SENTRY_DSN='https://1234@sentry.io/2345'
```

### Releasing

`craft` obviously uses `craft` for preparing and publishing new releases!
