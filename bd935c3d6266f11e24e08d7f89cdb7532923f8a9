## Implementation Plan

### Problem
When `craft prepare` creates a publish issue in `getsentry/publish`, the
changelog body contains `@author` mentions that ping every contributor.
For CalVer projects with regular release cadence this is excessive noise.

### Root Cause
`generateChangesetFromGit()` produces changelog with `disableMentions=false`
(the default).  The same `changelogBody` string flows to both CHANGELOG.md
(harmless — files don't trigger notifications) and the GitHub Actions file
output consumed by `action.yml` to build the publish issue body (pings).

### Approach
Post-process the changelog string *only* for the Actions output path.
Before `writeGitHubActionsFile` / `setGitHubActionsOutput`, detect CalVer
via two sources:

1. `argv.newVersion === "calver"` — user ran `craft prepare calver`
2. `getVersioningPolicy() === VersioningPolicy.CalVer` — config policy

If either matches, run a regex replacement that converts
` by @author in ` → ` by **author** in `, matching the exact output
format of `formatChangelogEntry()`.

### Files Changed
- `src/utils/helpers.ts` — new `disableChangelogMentions()` function
- `src/commands/prepare.ts` — conditional call before writing outputs
- `src/utils/__tests__/helpers.test.ts` — 7 tests for the regex helper

### Design Decisions
- Regex replacement over re-generating changelog: avoids expensive API
  calls and memoization cache complications
- Helper extracted to `helpers.ts` (alongside `truncateForOutput`) for
  independent testability
- CHANGELOG.md keeps @-mentions (clickable links, no notifications)
- Non-calver projects are completely unaffected
