## Investigation Plan

### Error
Release workflow failed with:
```
Unable to download artifact(s): Artifact not found for name: bf5e62f4136842f9f402e3516b5a3e28094213e7
```

From: https://github.com/getsentry/craft/actions/runs/21755074971

### Root Cause Analysis

1. Examined the failed GitHub Actions run - artifacts 'craft-binary' and 'craft-docs' were present
2. Explored artifact_providers/ to understand how artifacts are named/downloaded
3. Discovered the error was NOT from Craft's artifact provider code, but from the GitHub Action itself

### Finding

Mismatch between artifact names:
- build.yml (upload): `name: craft-binary`
- action.yml (download): `name: ${{ github.sha }}`

The action.yml was using legacy naming convention (commit SHA) while build.yml
was using the new explicit naming convention.

### Fix

Update action.yml line 96 to use `name: craft-binary` instead of `name: ${{ github.sha }}`
