## Implementation Plan

### Root Cause Analysis
The `spawnProcess` function was used but never imported in:
- `src/targets/pypi.ts` (line 193)
- `src/targets/crates.ts` (lines 204, 328)

### Why It Wasn't Caught
1. **esbuild doesn't type check** - Build uses esbuild which only transpiles
2. **Tests mocked the method** - Test replaced uploadAssets entirely with mock
3. **No type checking in CI** - tsc --noEmit was never run

### Fix Implementation
1. Add missing `spawnProcess` import to both files
2. Add test that mocks `spawnProcess` but calls real `uploadAssets` method
3. Add `typecheck` script to package.json for local development

### Prevention
- New test ensures import exists (would fail if removed)
- typecheck script available for developers to catch similar issues locally
- Full CI type checking deferred (150+ pre-existing type errors need fixing first)
