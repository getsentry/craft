## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Sentry 26.2.0 release failed because the CHANGELOG body exceeded GitHub's
125,000-character release body limit, causing a 422 error at
github.repos.createRelease().

### Root Cause
The changelog body extracted from CHANGELOG.md (via findChangeset →
extractChangeset) was passed directly to the GitHub API with no size check.
The Changeset object was spread into the API request parameters.

### Solution

#### 1. src/utils/changelog.ts
- Extend Changeset interface with optional startLine/endLine (1-indexed)
- Add getLineNumber() helper converting character positions to line numbers
- Modify extractChangeset() to compute line numbers from ChangesetLoc

#### 2. src/targets/github.ts
- Add GITHUB_RELEASE_BODY_MAX = 125,000 constant
- Add buildChangelogPermalink() to construct a permalink:
  https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{sha}/{changelog}#L{start}-L{end}
- Add truncateBody() to cut at last newline boundary before the limit and
  append a footer with the permalink
- Refactor createDraftRelease() to explicitly pass name and body (not spread)
  so startLine/endLine do not leak into the API request

#### 3. Tests
- changelog-file-ops.test.ts: 3 tests for startLine/endLine accuracy
  (first section, middle section, setext headings)
- github.test.ts: 5 tests for createDraftRelease truncation behavior
  (short body passthrough, empty body, truncation with permalink,
  line boundary truncation, no line fragment when absent, no extra fields)

### Design Decisions
- Optional fields on Changeset for backward compatibility
- Truncation at line boundaries to avoid cutting markdown mid-line
- Permalink with commit SHA so the link survives future CHANGELOG edits
- Truncation in createDraftRelease since it owns the API call and has access
  to revision and githubConfig
