# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for AI coding assistants working with the Craft codebase.

## Package Management

- **Always use `pnpm`** for package management. Never use `npm` or `yarn`.
- Node.js version is managed by [Volta](https://volta.sh/) (currently v22.12.0).
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

## Development Commands

| Command      | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm build` | Build the project (outputs to `dist/craft`) |
| `pnpm test`  | Run tests                                   |
| `pnpm lint`  | Run ESLint                                  |
| `pnpm fix`   | Auto-fix lint issues                        |

To manually test changes:

```bash
pnpm build && ./dist/craft
```

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** is used throughout the codebase.
- **Prettier** 3.x with single quotes and no arrow parens (configured in `.prettierrc.yml`).
- **ESLint** 9.x with flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) using `typescript-eslint`.
- Unused variables prefixed with `_` are allowed (e.g., `_unusedParam`).

```

## Testing

- Tests use **Vitest**.
- Test files are located in `src/__tests__/` and follow the `*.test.ts` naming pattern.
- Run tests with `pnpm test`.
- Use `vi.fn()`, `vi.mock()`, `vi.spyOn()` for mocking (Vitest's mock API).

## CI/CD

- Main branch is `master`.
- CI runs tests on Node.js 20 and 22.
- Craft releases itself using its own tooling (dogfooding).

## Configuration

- Project configuration lives in `.craft.yml` at the repository root.
- The configuration schema is defined in `src/schemas/`.

## Dry-Run Mode

Craft supports a `--dry-run` flag that prevents destructive operations. This is implemented via a centralized abstraction layer.

### How It Works

Instead of checking `isDryRun()` manually in every function, destructive operations are wrapped with dry-run-aware proxies:

- **Git operations**: Use `getGitClient()` from `src/utils/git.ts` or `createGitClient(directory)` for working with specific directories
- **GitHub API**: Use `getGitHubClient()` from `src/utils/githubApi.ts`
- **File writes**: Use `safeFs` from `src/utils/dryRun.ts`
- **Other actions**: Use `safeExec()` or `safeExecSync()` from `src/utils/dryRun.ts`

### ESLint Enforcement

ESLint rules prevent direct usage of raw APIs:

- `no-restricted-imports`: Blocks direct `simple-git` imports
- `no-restricted-syntax`: Blocks `new Octokit()` instantiation

If you're writing a wrapper module that needs raw access, use:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-imports -- This is the wrapper module
import simpleGit from 'simple-git';
```

### Adding New Destructive Operations

When adding new code that performs destructive operations:

1. **Git**: Get the git client via `getGitClient()` or `createGitClient()` - mutating methods are automatically blocked
2. **GitHub API**: Get the client via `getGitHubClient()` - `create*`, `update*`, `delete*`, `upload*` methods are automatically blocked
3. **File writes**: Use `safeFs.writeFile()`, `safeFs.unlink()`, etc. instead of raw `fs` methods
4. **Other**: Wrap with `safeExec(action, description)` for custom operations

### Special Cases

Some operations need explicit `isDryRun()` checks:

- Commands with their own `--dry-run` flag (e.g., `dart pub publish --dry-run` in pubDev target)
- Operations that need to return mock data in dry-run mode
- User experience optimizations (e.g., skipping sleep timers)

## Long-term Knowledge

### Pattern

<!-- lore:019c9b36-8f9d-71c9-a43a-d2715aa249d0 -->

- **Craft publish_repo 'self' sentinel resolves to GITHUB_REPOSITORY at runtime**: The composite action's \`publish_repo\` input supports a special sentinel value \`"self"\` which resolves to \`$GITHUB_REPOSITORY\` at runtime in the bash script of the 'Request publish' step. This allows repos to create publish request issues in themselves rather than in a separate \`{owner}/publish\` repo. The resolution happens in bash (not in the GitHub Actions expression) because the expression layer sets \`PUBLISH_REPO\` via \`inputs.publish_repo || format('{0}/publish', github.repository_owner)\` — the string \`"self"\` passes through as-is and gets resolved to the actual repo name in the shell. Useful for personal/small repos where the default GITHUB_TOKEN already has write access to the repo itself.
