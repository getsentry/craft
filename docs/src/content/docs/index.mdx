  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize a new project (one-time setup)
craft init

# Auto-determine version from conventional commits
craft prepare auto

# Or specify a bump type
craft prepare minor

# Or use an explicit version
craft prepare 1.2.3

# Then publish to all configured targets
craft publish 1.2.3
```

## Why Craft?

Craft enforces a specific workflow for managing release branches, changelogs, and artifact publishing. It:

- Creates release branches automatically
- Validates changelog entries
- Runs version-bumping scripts
- Waits for CI to complete
- Downloads build artifacts
- Publishes to configured targets
- Merges release branches back to main
