## Implementation Plan

### Changes to action.yml (lines 207-285)

Replace the simple 'skip if exists' logic with an 'update if exists' flow:

1. Fetch existing issue data including body and number (not just url)
2. Extract checked targets from existing body using grep/sed
3. Store checked targets in bash associative array for O(1) lookup
4. Apply preserved checked states to new targets list
5. Build fresh body with latest requester, merge target, links, changelog
6. Update existing issue via `gh issue edit` or create new issue

### Key Implementation Details

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Fetch existing issue data | Extended `gh issue list --json` to include `number` and `body` |
| Extract checked targets | grep/sed to parse `- [x] target` lines into associative array |
| Apply preserved states | Iterate through new targets, replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for matches |
| Update vs Create | Conditional: `gh issue edit` for existing, `gh issue create` for new |

### Behavior Matrix

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Target was `[x]`, still exists in config | Stays `[x]` |
| Target was `[ ]`, still exists in config | Stays `[ ]` |
| New target added to config | Starts as `[ ]` |
| Target removed from config | Not included |
| No existing issue | Creates new issue (unchanged) |

### Edge Cases Handled

- Target names with special characters (e.g., `npm[registry]`) work correctly
- Empty existing body is handled gracefully
- No checked targets in original issue is handled efficiently
